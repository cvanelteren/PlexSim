Welcome to Plexsim.

Fast and general  toolbox for simulation of complex adaptive  systems written in
cython.   *N.b.*   this    is   a   work   in   progress.    Docs   are   hosted
[[https://cvanelteren.github.io/PlexSim/][here]],      please       see      the
[[https://cvanelteren.github.io/PlexSim/build/html/quickstart.html][quickstart]] in the docs.

* Installation
- Clone the repo ~git clone git@github.com:cvanelteren/PlexSim.git && cd Plexsim~
- Install the requirements `pip install --file requirements.txt`
  
Current  versions are  developed on  ~linux~. It  is known  that compiling  with
cython on mac is  difficult due to the ~gcc~ compiler  being replaced with ~clang~
on apple. This toolbox depends on ~openmp~ and this could cause problems on 
MacOS.

* Notes
Cannot have static pyobjects, this causes a segfault in pybind11. 
Use atexit for cleaning them up.
