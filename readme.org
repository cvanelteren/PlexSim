Welcome to Plexsim.

Fast and general  toolbox for simulation of complex adaptive  systems written in
cython.   *N.b.*   this    is   a   work   in   progress.    Docs   are   hosted
[[https://cvanelteren.github.io/PlexSim/][here]],      please       see      the
[[https://cvanelteren.github.io/PlexSim/build/html/quickstart.html][quickstart]] in the docs.

* Installation
- Clone the repo ~git clone git@github.com:cvanelteren/PlexSim.git && cd Plexsim~
- Install the requirements ~pip install --file requirements.txt~
  
Current  versions are  developed on  ~linux~.

* Troubleshooting
*** Mac
It is  known that compiling  with cython  on mac is  difficult due to  the ~gcc~
compiler being replaced with ~clang~ on  apple. This toolbox depends on ~openmp~
and this could cause problems on MacOS.


*** GCC versions
The codebase  is tested and  developed on ~gcc  = 10.2.0~; higher  versions give
symbol errors at the time of writing.

* License
PlexSim is released under the GNU-GPLv3 license

* Notes
Cannot have static pyobjects, this causes a segfault in pybind11. 
Use atexit for cleaning them up.
